sentiment_analysis.py

Sentiment analysis allows us to detect the emotion behind a piece of text using Natural Language Processing

In this project we implement a sentiment analysis model using spaCy

This involves preprocessing the text data, removing stopwords, and performing any necessary text cleaning to prepare the reviews for analysis

The dataset has been processed by removing stopwords, missing values, several punctuations and converting to lowercase
