sentiment_analysis.py

Sentiment analysis allows us to detect the emotion behind a piece of text using Natural Language Processing

In this project we implement a sentiment analysis model using spaCy

This involves preprocessing the text data, removing stopwords, and performing any necessary text cleaning to prepare the reviews for analysis
 
Download a dataset of product reviews: Consumer Reviews of AmazonProducts. You can save it as a CSV file, naming it:
amazon_product_reviews.csv.  Ensure it is held in the same folder as the code

Screenshots of the project in action.
